Authors@R: person("Grant", "McDermott", role = c("aut", "cre"),
    email = "contact@grantmcdermott.com")
Description: A graphics device that records R plotting operations and streams
    them as JSON over a Unix domain socket to an external renderer. The device
    acts as a pure recorder with no rendering dependencies — all rendering
    occurs in the client (e.g. a VS Code webview or any NDJSON-capable
    frontend).
