Description: A graphics device that records R plotting operations and streams
    them to a VS Code extension for rendering in a webview. The device acts as
    a recorder, capturing display-list operations as JSON and transmitting them
    over a Unix domain socket. All rendering occurs in the browser via Canvas2D.
