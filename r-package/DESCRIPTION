Authors@R: person("jgd authors", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "jgd@example.com")
Description: A graphics device that records R plotting operations and streams
    them as JSON to an external renderer over a Unix domain socket. The device
    acts as a recorder — all rendering occurs in the client (e.g. a VS Code
    webview, browser tab, or any NDJSON-capable frontend) via Canvas2D.
